# DATA_Preprocessing ❄️


Data preprocessing for facial recognition using the Python Scikit-learn library

# In this code we have added the following steps:

1. Define the number of key components to keep for the CPA using the variable “n_components”.

2. Initialize the PCA object using the Scikit-learn PCA() method.

3. For each image, apply CPA to the data after face alignment. To do this, we have added the following steps:

  . Flatten the image into a 1D vector using the reshape() method.
  
  . Apply PCR to flattened data using the fit() method.
  
  . Transform flattened data using the transform() method.
  
  . Return the transformed data to the 2D image form using the reshape() method.
  
 4. Save the pre-processed image.

Note: 
The above code only covers part of the data preprocessing process for facial recognition, and it may be necessary to adjust the parameters to suit your specific needs.
